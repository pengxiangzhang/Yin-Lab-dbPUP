#  Functional Group Transfer Reactions (FRs) Family Classification

[TOC]

##  Introduction

In **Functional Group Transfer Reactions**, a functional group will be transferred from one molecule that serves as the donor molecule to another molecule that will be the acceptor molecule. This reaction can be performed by transferase which  participate in a myriad of different biochemical pathways throughout biology, and are integral to some of life's most important processes.

Transferases are involved in myriad reactions in the cell. Three examples of these reactions are the activity of coenzyme A (CoA) transferase, which transfers thiol esters [^1], the action of N-acetyltransferase, which is part of the pathway that metabolizes tryptophan [^2], and the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA[^3]. Transferases are also utilized during translation. In this case, an amino acid chain is the functional group transferred by a peptidyl transferase. The transfer involves the removal of the growing amino acid chain from the tRNA molecule in the A-site of the ribosome and its subsequent addition to the amino acid attached to the tRNA in the P-site.[^4]

##  Reaction

Mechanistically, an enzyme that catalyzed the following reaction would be a transferase:

X<sub>group</sub> + Y &rarr; X + Y<sub>group</sub>

where X is the donor that is often a coenzyme, and Y is the acceptor [^5]. Group would be the functional group that is transferred on account of transferase activity.

Described primarily based on the type of biochemical group transferred, transferases can be divided into ten categories (based on the EC Number classification). These categories comprise over 450 different unique enzymes. In the EC numbering system, transferases have been given a classification of **EC2**. Hydrogen is not considered a functional group when it comes to transferase targets; instead, hydrogen transfer is included under oxidoreductases, due to electron transfer considerations.
