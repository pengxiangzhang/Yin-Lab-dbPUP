| Abstract | Phloretin hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolytic C-C cleavage of phloretin to phloroglucinol and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid during flavonoid degradation in *Eubacterium ramulus*. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by screening a gene library for hydrolase activity. The insert of a clone conferring phloretin hydrolase activity was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 822 bp (*phy*), a putative promoter region, and a terminating stem-loop structure. The deduced amino acid sequence of *phy* showed similarities to a putative protein of the 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthetic operon from *Pseudomonas fluorescens*. The phloretin hydrolase was heterologously expressed in *Escherichia coli* and purified. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 55 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the deduced amino acid sequence of *phy* indicated molecular masses of 30 and 30.8 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the enzyme is a homodimer. The recombinant phloretin hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of phloretin to equimolar amounts of phloroglucinol and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. The optimal temperature and pH of the catalyzed reaction mixture were 37°C and 7.0, respectively. The *Km* for phloretin was 13 ± 3 μM and the *k*cat was 10 ± 2 s−1. The enzyme did not transform phloretin-2′-glucoside (phloridzin), neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propandione, or *trans*-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxy-propan-1-one. The catalytic activity of the phloretin hydrolase was reduced by *N*-bromosuccinimide, *o*-phenanthroline, *N*-ethylmaleimide, and CuCl2 to 3, 20, 35, and 85%, respectively. Phloroglucinol and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid reduced the activity to 54 and 70%, respectively. |

Description:

DAPG_hydrolase

[**Pfam**](https://pfam.xfam.org/family/DAPG_hydrolase)

This domain is found in 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol hydrolase PhiG present in Pseudomonas fluorescens. 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol hydrolase is the gene product of PhiG that is responsible for cleaving toxic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). The small N-terminal region of the domain is involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding of the dimer interface. The C-terminal catalytic region resembles the tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase and has a Bet v1-like fold. DAPG PhiG is the first discovered hydrolase whose catalytic domain belongs to the Bet v1-like fold, rather than the classical alpha/beta-fold hydrolases[^1].
