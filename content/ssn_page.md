This page displays the visualization of Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) from Cytoscape. All the seeds+Swiss-Prot+TrEMBL homologs are included. The first figure is an overview of sequences in this family. Nodes in dark color indicate a subgroup/subfamily containing seeds, while nodes in light color indicates PUP homologs that are distant from seeds.

The others are enlarged figures for each subfamily or high confidence (HC) subset.. Nodes are filled by different color according to their taxonomic rank **order**. Additionally, nodes have a light yellow border indicate the seeds.
