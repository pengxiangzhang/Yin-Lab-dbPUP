This page displays the visualization of Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) from Cytoscape. The first figure is a overview
of sequences in this family. Nodes in dark color indicate a subgroup containing seeds, while the light ones indicates
individuals that distant with seeds.

The others are enlarged pictures for each subfamily or high confidence (HC) if they donâ€™t have a subfamily. Nodes are
filled by different color depending on their taxonomic rank **order**. Additionally, nodes have a light yellow border
indicate the seeds.
