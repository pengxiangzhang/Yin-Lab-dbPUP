| Abstract | A culture filtrate of *
Bacillus* sp. KT12 was used to prepare polyphenyl β-oligoxylosides from xylan and polyphenols in a one-step reaction. One oligoxyloside transfer enzyme was purified from multiple xylanolytic enzymes in the culture filtrate. N-terminal amino acid sequence determination classified the enzyme as a glycosyl hydrolase family 11 (endo-xylanase). The xylanolytic enzyme activities could be markedly altered; its hydrolytic activity was almost entirely inhibited at acidic pH, whereas near constant transxylosylation activity was observed at pH 4–11. Further, metal ions activated transxylosylation and almost completely inhibited hydrolysis. The enzyme specifically induced a β-xylosyl transfer reaction to acceptor molecules, such as divalent and trivalent phenolic hydroxyl groups, and displayed no activity toward alcoholic compounds. The *
Bacillus* sp. KT12 xylanolytic enzyme was a suitable enzyme for the synthesis of polyphenyl β-oligoxylosides. |

The microbial degradation of cellulose and xylans requires several types of enzymes such as
endoglucanases ([3.2.1.4](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?cmd=SearchEC&ec=3.2.1.4)),
cellobiohydrolases ([3.2.1.91](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?cmd=SearchEC&ec=3.2.1.91)) (exoglucanases), or
xylanases ([3.2.1.8](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?cmd=SearchEC&ec=3.2.1.8))[^1][^2]. Fungi and bacteria produces a
spectrum of cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases) and xylanases which, on the basis of sequence similarities, can be
classified into families. One of these families is known as the cellulase family G[^3] or as the glycosyl hydrolases
family 11 (GH11)[^4].

The GH11 domain folds into a jelly-roll shape likened to a partially closed right hand. Several anti-parallel
beta-strands bend almost 90deg to produce a substrate-binding groove characteristic of the GH11 domain active sites. Two
catalytic Glu residues face each other from opposite sides of the groove. The hydrolysis reaction is believed to follow
a double- displacement mechanism, with one Glu residue acting as a general acid/base catalyst and the other as a
nucleophile.
