# Translocation Reactions (TRs) Family Classification

[TOC]

## Introduction

Translocase is a general term for a protein that assists in moving another molecule, usually across a cell membrane.
These enzymes catalyze the movement of ions or molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes. The
reaction is designated as a transfer from “side 1” to “side 2” because the designations “in” and “out”, which had
previously been used, can be ambiguous[^1]. Translocases are the most common secretion system in Gram positive bacteria.

The enzyme classification and nomenclature list was first approved by the International Union of Biochemistry in 1961.
Six enzyme classes have been recognized based on the type of chemical reaction catalyzed, including oxidoreductases (EC
1), transferases (EC 2), hydrolases (EC 3), lyases (EC 4), isomerases (EC 5) and ligases (EC 6). However, it was not
noticed back at the time that none of these classes clearly describe an important group of enzymes, which move ions or
molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes. Although the hydrolytic reaction is not the primary
function, several of these enzymes are involved the hydrolysis of ATP had been previously classified as ATPases (EC
3.6.3.-). Nowadays, these enzymes have been classified under a new EC class of translocases (EC 7).

Translocase are sorted as **EC 7** in the EC number classification of enzymes and can be further classified into seven
subclasses.

## Reaction

The reaction most translocases catalyse is:

AX + B<sub>side 1</sub>|| = A + X + ||B<sub>side 2</sub> [^2]

A clear example of an enzyme that follows this scheme is H+-transporting two-sector ATPase:

ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O + 4H<sup>+</sup><sub>side 1</sub> = ADP + phosphate + 4H<sup>+</sup><sub>side 2</sub>

This ATPase carries out the dephosphorylation of ATP into ADP while it transports H+ to the other side of the
membrane[^3]. However, other enzymes that also fall into this category do not follow the same reaction scheme. This is
the case of ascorbate ferrireductase:

ascorbate<sub>side 1</sub>    + Fe(III)<sub>side 2</sub> = monodehydroascorbate<sub>side 1</sub> + Fe(II)<sub>side
2</sub>

In which the enzyme only transports an electron in the catalysation of an oxidoreductase reaction between a molecule and
an inorganic cation located on different sides of the membrane[^4].
