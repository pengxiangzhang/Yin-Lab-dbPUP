##Oxidation/Reduction Reactions (ORs) Family Classification

---

####Introduction

**Oxidation/Reduction Reactions** can be catalyzed by  oxidoreductase that involves the transfer of electrons from one molecule, the reductant, also called the electron donor, to another, the oxidant, also called the electron acceptor. 

The substrate oxidized is regarded as a hydrogen or electron donor. The classification is based on 'donor:acceptor oxidoreductase'. The common name is 'dehydrogenase', wherever this is possible; as an alternative, 'acceptor reductase' can be used. 'Oxidase' is used only where O~2~ is an acceptor. Classification is difficult in some cases, because of the lack of specificity towards the acceptor.

Oxidorecuctases can be either oxidases or dehydrogenases. Oxidases are generally involved when molecular oxygen functions as an acceptor of hydrogen or electrons. However, dehydrogenases work by oxidizing a substrate through transferring hydrogen to an acceptor that is either NAD/NADP or a flavin enzyme. Peroxidases, hydroxylases, oxygenases, and reductases also belong to oxidoreductases. Peroxidases are placed in peroxisomes, and could catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Hydroxylases give hydroxyl groups to its substrates. Oxygenases could incorporate oxygen from molecular oxygen into organic substrates. In most cases, reductases can act like oxidases, but catalyzing reductions.

Oxidoreductases are sorted as **EC 1** in the EC number classification of enzymes and can be further classified into 22 subclasses.

####Reactions

The catalyzed reactions are similar to the following reaction:

A~red~ + B~ox~ &rarr;Â A~ox~ + B~red~

where A is the reductant (electron donor) and B is the oxidant (electron acceptor). 

In biochemical reactions, the redox reactions are sometimes more difficult to observe, such as this reaction from glycolysis:

 Pi + glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + NAD^+^&rarr; NADH + H<sup>+</sup> + 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate

where NAD^+^ is the oxidant (electron acceptor), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate functions as reductant (electron donor).
