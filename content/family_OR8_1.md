| Abstract | Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase from *Bacillus subtilis* (QueD) converts the flavonol ==quercetin== and molecular oxygen to ==2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinolcarboxylic acid== and carbon monoxide. QueD, the only known quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase from a prokaryotic organism, has been described as an Fe<sup>2+</sup>-dependent bicupin dioxygenase. Metal-substituted QueDs were generated by expressing the enzyme in *Escherichia coli* grown on minimal media in the presence of a number of divalent metals. The addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup> generated active enzymes, but the addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Cd<sup>2+</sup> did not increase quercetinase activity to any significant level over a control in which no divalent ions were added to the media. The Mn2+- and Co2+-containing QueDs were purified, characterized by metal analysis and EPR spectroscopy, and studied by steady-state kinetics. Mn<sup>2+</sup> was found to be incorporated nearly stoichiometrically to the two cupin motifs. The hyperfine coupling constant of the *g* = 2 signal in the EPR spectra of the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-containing enzyme showed that the two Mn2+ ions are ligated in an octahedral coordination. The turnover number of this enzyme was found to be in the order of 25 s<sup>-1</sup>, nearly 40-fold higher than that of the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-containing enzyme and similar in magnitude to that of the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-containing quercertin 2,3-dioxygenase from *Aspergillus japonicus*. In addition, kinetic and spectroscopic data suggest that the catalytic mechanism of QueD is different from that of the *Aspergillus* quercetinases but similar to that proposed for the extradiol catechol dioxygenases. This study provides evidence that Mn2+ might be the preferred cofactor for this enzyme and identifies QueD as a new member of the manganese dioxygenase family. |
