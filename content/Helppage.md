## dbPUP

**dbPUP** is the first exploratory database of polyphenol utilized proteins that have been **experimentally validated** to catalyze or modify a polyphenol substrate. The database contains 60 proteins from **gut microbiota** that characterized by heterologous or homologous expression with one or more specific polyphenol substrates, as well as over 24,000 proteins that are potentially capable of interaction with polyphenols.

## Evidence Page

This page displays an interactive table of all experimentally validated entries in dbPUP. Users can sort in ascending or descending order the number, strain, protein name, gene name, uniprot id, EC, substrate, product, PDB, Km, Vmax and Kcat.

Users can jump to a specific page looking for more details by clicking on blue text links in cell.

## Class Page

One the Class page, users can find essential information about introduction, reaction description, Pfam of seeds, subfamily and EC. Clicking the Family name (e.g. OR1) will redirect users to Family page, where exhibits experimental results in very detail.

### Family Page

Metadata and general information about the seeds in this family, including literature information and Experimental results.

The Literature Information tab displays the title, authors, DOI and abstract of the corresponding publication. Polyphenols that involved in biochemical experiments are highlighted in abstract.

![help3](../static/images/text_content/figures/help3.png){: .fit}

Experimental results tab displays the entry, Pfam and reaction information based on the above literature. Clicking blue text links redirects users to corresponding pages for more details.

### Table for Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL result

Both Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL tables consist of seven major parts of protein name (a), strain (b), uniprot (c), PDB (d), family (e), EC (f) and sequence (g). Users view the taxa of interest in same table by clicking the buttons (h) above the table.

### Phylogenetic tree

Users can view a rectangular phylogenetic tree, if available, by clicking the tree button above the Swiss-Prot table. Features of the phylogenetic tree include:

- Simply click and drag with mouse to move the tree, 
- Adjust the display zoom level by mouse wheel.
- Click any internal tree node to collapse a clade.
- Highlighted seed id and its closed branches.

### SSN visualization

Uses can find SSN visualization result for each family by clicking the network button above the TrEMBL table. 

The first figure is a overview of sequences in this family. Usually, edges represent an E-value threshold below 10-<sup>80</sup>. Nodes in dark color indicate a subgroup containing seeds, while the light ones indicates individuals that distant with seeds. 

The others are enlarged pictures for each subfamily. Nodes are filled by different color depending on their taxa. Additionally, nodes have a light yellow border indicate the seeds.
