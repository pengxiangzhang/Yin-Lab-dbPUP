| Abstract | Gut bacteria play a crucial role in the metabolism of dietary flavonoids and thereby influence the bioactivity of these compounds in the host. The intestinal *Lachnospiraceae* strain CG19‐1 and *Eubacterium cellulosolvens* are able to deglycosylate *C*‐ and *O*‐coupled flavonoid glucosides. Growth of strain CG19‐1 in the presence of the isoflavone *C*‐glucoside puerarin (daidzein 8‐*C*‐glucoside) led to the induction of two proteins (DfgC, DfgD). Heterologous expression of the encoding genes (*dfgC*, *dfgD*) in *Escherichia coli* revealed no *C*‐deglycosylating activity in the resulting cell extracts but cleavage of flavonoid *O*‐glucosides such as daidzin (daidzein 7‐*O*‐glucoside). The recombinant DfgC and DfgD proteins were purified and characterized with respect to their quaternary structure, substrate and cofactor specificity. The products of the corresponding genes (*dfgC*, *dfgD*) from *E. cellulosolvens* also catalysed the ==*O*‐deglycosylation of daidzin== following their expression in *E. coli*. In combination with three recombinant proteins encoded by adjacent genes in *E. cellulosolvens* (*dfgA*, *dfgB*, *dfgE*), DfgC and DfgD from *E.  cellulosolvens* catalysed the deglycosylation of the flavone *C*‐glucosides homoorientin (luteolin 6‐*C*‐glucoside) and isovitexin (apigenin 6‐*C*‐glucoside). Even intact cells of *E. coli* expressing the five *E. cellulosolvens* genes cleaved these flavone *C*‐glucosides and, also, flavonoid *O*‐glucosides to the corresponding aglycones. |

Description:

GFO_IDH_MocA

[**Pfam**](https://pfam.xfam.org/family/GFO_IDH_MocA)

This family of enzymes utilise NADP or NAD. This family is called the GFO/IDH/MOCA family in swiss-prot.

[**InterPro**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR000683/)

This group of enzymes utilise NADP or NAD, and is known as the GFO/IDH/MOCA family in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. GFO is a glucose--fructose oxidoreductase, which converts D-glucose and D-fructose into D-gluconolactone and D-glucitol in the sorbitol-gluconate pathway. MOCA is a rhizopine catabolism protein which may catalyse the NADH-dependent dehydrogenase reaction involved in rhizopine catabolism. Other proteins belonging to this family include Gal80, a negative regulator for the expression of lactose and galactose metabolic genes; and several hypothetical proteins from yeast, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.

The oxidoreductase, N-terminal domain is almost always associated with the oxidoreductase, C-terminal domain (see [IPR004104](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR004104/)).
