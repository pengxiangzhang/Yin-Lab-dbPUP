# Unclassified (UCs) Family Classification

[TOC]

## Introduction

Sequences in this class have no significant pfams, while experiments  have strong evidences supporting their participation in polyphenol metabolism. These families are expanded by `PSI-Blast` rather than `hmmsearch` under a unified threshold (E-value < 0.001 and run until convergence).
