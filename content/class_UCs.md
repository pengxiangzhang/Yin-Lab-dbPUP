# Unclassified (UCs) Family Classification

[TOC]

## Introduction

Some seeds in Evidence have no significant pfams, while experiments have strong evidences supporting their participation
in polyphenol metabolism. These sequences were classified into Unclassified (UCs) and subsequently were expanded
by `PSI-Blast` rather than `hmmsearch` under a unified threshold (E-value 0.001 and run until convergence).
