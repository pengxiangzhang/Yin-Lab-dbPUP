# BLAST

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to **dbPUP databases** and calculates the statistical significance of matches. We provide an integrated BLAST service to find homologs in our dbPUP and  infer a putative family with your protein sequences.

1. Enter a protein or nucleotide sequence into the form field.
2. Or upload a FASTA format file
3. Click the Run Blast button.
