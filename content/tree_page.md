This page displays the phylogenetic tree constructed by using all the sequences from Swiss-Prot in this family. These sequences were processed by a multiple sequence alignment program [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/).
Then [FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Usage) was used to calculate approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from sequence alignment.
