##  Literature Information

| Title    | Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucansucrase synthesis of flavonoid glucosides by acceptor reactions in aqueous-organic solvents |

| Author   | Anne Bertrand, Sandrine Morel, François Lefoulon, Yves Rolland, Pierre Monsan, Magali Remaud-Simeon |
| DOI      | [10.1016/j.carres.2006.02.008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2006.02.008) |
| Abstract | The enzymatic glucosylation of luteolin was attempted using two glucansucrases: the dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F and the alternansucrase from *L. mesenteroides* NRRL B-23192. Reactions were carried out in aqueous-organic solvents to improve luteolin solubility. A molar conversion of 44% was achieved after 24h of reaction catalysed by dextransucrase from L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F in a mixture of acetate buffer (70%)/bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (30%). Two products were characterised by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: luteolin-3'-O-alpha-d-glucopyranoside and luteolin-4'-O-alpha-d-glucopyranoside. In the presence of alternansucrase from *L. mesenteroides* NRRL B-23192, three additional products were obtained with a luteolin conversion of 8%. Both enzymes were also able to glucosylate quercetin and myricetin with conversion of 4% and 49%, respectively. |

Description:

Glyco_hydro_70

[**Pfam**](https://pfam.xfam.org/family/Glyco_hydro_70)

Members of this family belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 70[^1] Glucosyltransferases or sucrose 6-glycosyl transferases (GTF-S) catalyse the transfer of D-glucopyramnosyl units from sucrose onto acceptor molecules[^2] EC:2.4.1.5. This family roughly corresponds to the N-terminal catalytic domain of the enzyme. Members of this family also contain the Putative cell wall binding domain [PF01473](https://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF01473) which corresponds with the C-terminal glucan-binding domain.

[**InterPro**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR003318/)

O-Glycosyl hydrolases ([3.2.1.](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?cmd=SearchEC&ec=3.2.1.)) are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition of 85 different families [^3][^4]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) website.

Glucosyltransferases or sucrose 6-glycosyl transferases (GTF-S) ([2.4.1.5](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?md=SearchEC&ec=2.4.1.5), [GH70](http://www.cazy.org/fam/GH70.html)) catalyse the transfer of D-glucopyramnosyl units from sucrose onto acceptor molecules [^2]. This entry represents a domain that roughly corresponds to the N-terminal catalytic domain of the enzyme. Members of this family also contain the putative cell wall binding domain [PF01473](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/PF01473/) which corresponds with the C-terminal glucan-binding domain.
